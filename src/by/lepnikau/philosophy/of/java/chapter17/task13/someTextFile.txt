At GitHub, we believe in the extraordinary potential and power of a diverse,
collaborative developer community to accelerate human progress.
Just look at the first-ever powered flight on another planet as one amazing
example of what developers can achieve together! Through the power of this
community, we have an opportunity to make a positive, lasting impact on our
planet, too.
